Project: Caesar Cipher
=============

A basic terminal-based app that allows users to submit a string and have it cryptographed using [Caesar Cipher](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=36xNpbosfTY).

Here's the [live project demo.](https://replit.com/@AlanSobchacki/odin-caesar-cipher) (NOTE: You'll need a Replit account to run it.)

You can also run it if you have Ruby installed in your system, by running 'ruby caesar_cipher.rb' on your terminal.

About
-----

This project was completed as part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) [Ruby](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby) curriculum. It is the second project required for completion of the Ruby Course [1/12].

These were the project requirements:

- [x] Implement a caesar cipher that takes in a string and the shift factor and then outputs the modified string.
- [x] It needs to keep the same case.

What I Learned
-----

My first Ruby code! I learned how to get users inputs (gets.chomp), running if/else conditions, building classes and objects... a fun ride.
